/**
 * Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. It is used to
 * specify access control policies for Cloud Platform resources.
 * A `Policy` consists of a list of `bindings`. A `binding` binds a list of
 * `members` to a `role`, where the members can be user accounts, Google groups,
 * Google domains, and service accounts. A `role` is a named list of permissions
 * defined by IAM.
 * **JSON Example**
 *     {
 *       "bindings": [
 *         {
 *           "role": "roles/owner",
 *           "members": [
 *             "user:mike&#64;example.com",
 *             "group:admins&#64;example.com",
 *             "domain:google.com",
 *             "serviceAccount:my-other-app&#64;appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
 *           ]
 *         },
 *         {
 *           "role": "roles/viewer",
 *           "members": ["user:sean&#64;example.com"]
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 * **YAML Example**
 *     bindings:
 *     - members:
 *       - user:mike&#64;example.com
 *       - group:admins&#64;example.com
 *       - domain:google.com
 *       - serviceAccount:my-other-app&#64;appspot.gserviceaccount.com
 *       role: roles/owner
 *     - members:
 *       - user:sean&#64;example.com
 *       role: roles/viewer
 * For a description of IAM and its features, see the
 * [IAM developer's guide](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs).
